#### Given an array of size N-1 such that it only contains distinct integers in the range of 1 to N. Find the missing element.

Example 1:
```
Input:
N = 5
A[] = {1,2,3,5}

Output: 4
```
Example 2:
```
Input:
N = 10
A[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10}

Output: 9
```
Constraints:
- 1 ≤ N ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>
- 1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 10<sup>6</sup>
